# VisualizingRobotConsepts
This repo. was made to visualize robot consepts like Kinematics and ROS.

I'd like to use ROS2 as it is more mature at this pointand and since it is available on Ubuntu, Windows, and MacOS, whereas ROS1 is only available on Ubuntu.
This will make it easier for students to use.
The distro. of ROS2 I plan to use is [Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html).
For the first version, I'll program this using Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy). This is because Humble Hawksbill is only supportedon Windows 10, and I have Windows 11. In the future I might consider making a docker container that can run my code on any OS.
I'll be using rviz for the visualtzation, and the python programming language.
